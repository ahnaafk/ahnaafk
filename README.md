Iâ€™m an 18 y/o self-taught neurotech developer and graphic designer. 

Currently, an undergraduate @ Queen's University studying Mechatronics Engineering while exploring and writing about different avenues in carbon capture & profitability. Recently, I've been particularly interested in the space of electrochemical graphite synthesis from CO2. 

In the past, I co-founded NeuraDAO, a neurotech / web3 organization which was a holistic network for neurotech where you can fund, publish, and contribute to research. Some accomplishments from that time include: 
- Crowdfunding $6,000+ USD on Gitcoin
- Stage presence at several global conferences (ETHAmsterdam, Collision, etc.)
- Building a world-class team of neuroscience Ph.Ds, web3/web2 developers, and IP lawyers dedicated to driving the neurotech space forward
- Building a community filled with hundreds of neurotech researchers, scientists, etc.

Additionally, while building NeuraDAO I spoke on several stages across the globe about my work in web3 and what the future of web3 looks like.

Looking forward, I would like to build out a small carbon capture device in my dorm room.
